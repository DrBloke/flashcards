- [x] Buttons need borders, or maybe focus indicator will do
- [x] Refactor Flashcard HTML into more sections, e.g. header and footer
- [x] ES Lint and Prettify setup and run; If you use ESLint, make sure lint-staged runs it before Prettier, not after.
- [ ] Search for ESlinter and prettify for .astro files; https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-astro and the a11y one
- [ ] Update Astro

- [ ] Focus on the buttons after flipping
- [ ] Don't reshow cards if right on first attempt (optional)
- [ ] Progress indicator

## Issues

- [ ] Mark correct on last round re-renders first card before relocating. Render a success message instead.
- [ ] I think the use of side1 and side2 my be a poor choice. It should instead be an array. This would help when I have cards with more than two sides.
